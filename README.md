# cesm_dev
The cesm_dev repository is dedicated to CESM development which encompass:
- Development simulations (including cases directories and model sandboxes).
- Relevant discussions to model development (e.g. discussions of biases, tuning, ...).
- Spreadsheet to track development tasks.

## Development simulations
Note that the cesm development simulations are currently tracked under another [repo](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev/). This is for historical reasons and the simulations will be tracked in the cirrent repo soon.

The list of cesm development simulations can be found under [Issues](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev/issues). 
  - Each simulation is represented as a github issue. 
  - Simulations can be sorted with labels (for instance, compset: BLT1850). 

To request a new simulation run, please use the [Run request](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev/issues/new/choose) template. 
  - Please provide as much details as possible. 

## Discussions 
Discussions relevant to cesm development could be posted under [Discussions](https://github.com/NCAR/cesm_dev/discussions).

  - To ensure that the conversation remains productive and helpful, please keep your discussions organized by using relevant titles, applying labels, and refraining from mixing topics.
