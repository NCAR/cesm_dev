# cesm_dev
The `cesm_dev` repository is dedicated to the ongoing development of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and includes:
- **Development simulations**. Comprehensive information about individual runs, including case directories.
- **Relevant discussions**: Topics related to model development, such as bias identification and tuning.
- **Task Tracking**: A spreadsheet to manage development tasks.

## Development simulations
Please note that for historical reasons, CESM development simulations before version 109 were tracked in a different repo [amwg_dev](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev/) . Starting with simulation 110 and the ***code chill*** (effective August 31, 2024), all CESM coupled development simulations are documented in this repository.

You can find a list of CESM development simulations under the [Issues](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev/issues) section. 
  - Each simulation is recorded as a github issue. 
  - Simulations can be sorted with labels (for instance, compset: BLT1850). 

To request a new simulation run, please use the [Run request](https://github.com/NCAR/amwg_dev/issues/new/choose) template. and provide as much details as possible. 

## Discussions 
Relevant discussions about CESM development should be posted under the [Discussions](https://github.com/NCAR/cesm_dev/discussions) section.
  
  - Discussions provide you with the ability to directly engage with other developers while staying on GitHub.
  - To ensure that the conversation remains productive and helpful, please keep your discussions organized by using relevant titles, applying labels, and refraining from mixing topics.

## Projects
A spreadsheet tracking current CESM development tasks is available under the [Projects](https://github.com/NCAR/cesm_dev/projects) section.
  
  - Each task basically one or a collection of discussions about specific issues in cesm.
